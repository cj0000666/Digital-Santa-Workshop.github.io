              <h1>Facts about Jesus I Bet You Din't Know</h1>

                <div class="fact">

                    
                    
                    <h2><span>1.</span> Jesusâ€™ Early Life is Largely Unrecorded</h2>

                    <p>While the Gospels provide detailed accounts of Jesusâ€™ birth, ministry, 
                        and death, very little is known about His early years. 
                        This period, often referred to as the "hidden years," 
                        spans from His infancy to His public appearance at around age 30. 
                        Scholars suggest that He likely worked as a carpenter alongside Joseph, 
                        but these years remain a mystery. This lack of 
                        documentation invites reflection on His humanity and ordinary upbringing.</p>

                    <h2><span>2.</span> Jesus Had Siblings</h2>

                    <p>The Gospels mention brothers and sisters of Jesus, including James, 
                        Joseph, Simon, and Judas. While some traditions suggest these were
                         cousins or step-siblings, many scholars believe they were His biological 
                         half-siblings from Mary and Joseph. This familial detail adds a layer of 
                         elatability, showing that Jesus grew up in a household similar to many others.

                    <h2><span>3.</span> Jesus Spoke Multiple Languages</h2>

                    <p>Living in first-century Galilee, Jesus likely spoke Aramaic
                         as His primary language. However, He also knew Hebrew,
                          the liturgical language of Jewish scripture, and Greek, which was
                           commonly used in commerce and governance. This multilingual ability 
                           highlights Jesusâ€™ cultural and social adaptability in reaching diverse audiences.

                    <h2><span>4.</span> Jesus Was Baptized, Though Sinless</h2>

                    <p>Despite being sinless, Jesus chose to be baptized by John the Baptist 
                        in the Jordan River. This act symbolized His solidarity with humanity
                         and marked the beginning of His public ministry. It was also a moment 
                         of divine revelation, as the heavens opened and God declared,
                          "This is my Son, whom I love."

                    <h2><span>5.</span> Jesusâ€™ Birthplace Was Likely Crowded</h2>

                    <p>Bethlehem, where Jesus was born, was bustling during the Roman census,
                         which is why Mary and Joseph struggled to find lodging. Jesusâ€™ birth 
                         in a manger emphasizes humility, as He entered the world not in a palace but in a setting 
                        shared with animals. This modest start underlines the profound message of His life.</p>

                    <h2><span>6.</span> Jesus Experienced Human Emotions</h2>

                    <p>Though divine, Jesus felt the full range of human emotions. He wept at Lazarusâ€™ tomb, 
                        expressed anger when cleansing the temple, and felt anguish in the Garden of Gethsemane. 
                        These moments reveal His deep compassion and ability to connect 
                        with human struggles on a profound level.</p>

                    <h2><span>7.</span> Jesus Often Used Parables to Teach</h2>

                    <p>Jesusâ€™ teachings were filled with parablesâ€”simple stories with profound moral lessons.
                         This method allowed Him to connect with people of all backgrounds while encouraging
                          deeper reflection. Stories like the Good Samaritan and the Prodigal Son remain timeless,
                           showcasing His genius as a teacher.</p>

                    <h2><span>8.</span> Jesus Performed Miracles for Non-Believers</h2>

                    <p>Many of Jesusâ€™ miracles, such as healing the Roman centurionâ€™s servant or the Samaritan leper,
                         were performed for individuals outside the Jewish faith. These acts illustrate
                         His mission to bring salvation to all people, regardless of their background or beliefs,
                          embodying inclusivity and divine compassion.</p>

                    <h2><span>9.</span> Jesusâ€™ Death Fulfilled Over 300 Prophecies</h2>

                    <p>Jesusâ€™ crucifixion and resurrection are believed to have fulfilled over
                         300 Old Testament prophecies. These include details about His betrayal,
                         suffering, and victory over death. Such fulfillment is seen as evidence of His 
                         divine mission and a testament to Godâ€™s plan unfolding over centuries.

                    <h2><span>10.</span> Jesusâ€™ Resurrection is the Cornerstone of Christianity</h2>

                    <p>The resurrection of Jesus is unique among world religions and is central
                         to Christian faith. It signifies victory over sin and death, offering hope 
                         to believers. Unlike other religious leaders who died and remained in their tombs, 
                         Jesusâ€™ resurrection sets Him apart as divine and living, forever transforming
                          history and faith.</p>
